# Fragger

Fragger is used in mutagenesis experiments. It locates altered DNA fragments in a set of DNA sequences. A threshold controls how much the fragments may differ from the original sequence to be considered a subsequence.

Fragments are shown at their respective position in the sequence, as well as highlighted in the primary structure. Same fragments are shown in the same color throughout all sequences. Colors can be controlled by the user.

## How to use

1. Insert the original sequences in `input_sequences.js`
1. Insert the fragments in `input_fragments.js`
1. Set threshold for alterations and control colors with `input_settings.js`
1. Open `index.htm` in your web browser

Detailed instructions are given in each file.
